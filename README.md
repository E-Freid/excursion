## about this project:
this is a Codecademy project I was asked to do.
I needed to follow a mockup and a design mock to create this project the way they wanted.

## Whats in this project:
* html
* css

## experience I take with me:
* gained more exp in html stracture and tags. I have used sematic html. included header, footer and sections with id and classes.
* becuase I used id' and classes I was able to make the css code more readable and used less code repitition.
* I have encountered a problem with the autoplay not working. after checking why the video wasn't auto-playing, apperntly it was an ios problem only with autoplay policy. and so I was able to find a fix in stackoverflow and apply it to my project and fixed the problem.
